## Developer Test

### Overview

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a simple website that will be able to perform a search using the Search API for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.

The output should be a webpage page that displays matching movies with their details (title, year, runtime) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word from the list from the movie title, and show it somewhere on the movie details (maybe as the background colour).

Things we are looking for:
- use of a backend framework (Wordpress, Laravel, Strapi) and relevant skills within that system
- use of a frontend framework and relevant skills within that system
- use of a front end pre-processor
- use of git (please provide your git log)
- use of a database

Optional functionality you may like to include
